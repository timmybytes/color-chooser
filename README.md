This is a React app that randomly generates a color swatch when the user clicks on it. The goal of this project was to practice React Hooks and responsive layout, and well as implement some of JavaScript's Math() functionality.

### To Do

- Add more swatches to create random palettes
- Give user ability to export palette
- Allow for a night/day mode to measure contrast of colors
