# Color Chooser

![Color Chooser Screenshot](./src/img/color-chooser-screenshot.png)

This is a React SPA that uses Hooks to randomly generate a color swatch, and allows for the current color to be saved to the user's clipboard.

The goal of this project was to practice React Hooks and responsive layout, and well as implement some of JavaScript's Math() functionality.
